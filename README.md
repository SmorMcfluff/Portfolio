A very short 2D platforming fighting game made for the [Stop Killing Games Community Jam](https://itch.io/jam/stop-killing-games-game-jam).

One of my first solo game jam projects. Originally meant to be a 10 minute story game about your favourite MMO dying, but I was quickly reminded of the fact that solo developing takes forever.
